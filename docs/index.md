# AI-Driven Hybrid Cloud Infrastructure · Documentation Hub

This documentation hub presents a structured, end-to-end blueprint for architecting, deploying, and operationalizing a production-grade AI infrastructure platform. It emulates the design principles, integration patterns, and operational challenges commonly encountered in modern hybrid environments, including cloud-native, on-premises, and virtualized systems. Emphasis is placed on resilience, observability, automation, and fault remediation across the entire lifecycle.

## 🧠 Project Vision

> Build a hybrid AI platform using production-grade practices — document every stage, challenge, and fix along the way.

You’ll find:
- Structured **phases** representing real-world milestones
- Self-hosted services that simulate **internal infrastructure**
- Diagnosed **failures** and their root causes
- End-to-end **AI service pipelines** with CI/CD and observability
